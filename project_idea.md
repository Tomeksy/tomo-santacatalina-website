## Overview

A website for TOMO, a restaurant in Santa Catalina, Palma de Mallorca. The site presents the restaurant, its identity, and invites visitors to experience it in person.

- Health-conscious diners seeking natural, protein-rich food
- People drawn to unique spaces with character and story

## Brand Essence

The recurring theme throughout the menu: Tomato, Mozzarella, Pesto.

## What the Website Should Communicate

### Atmosphere & Experience
The website should make visitors feel what it's like to be at Tomo. The space features living moss walls, natural wood elements, and original artwork by artist Juri Art. Professional photos exist showing guests enjoying the food, the artist at work, and the interior. These visuals should play a central role.

### Identity & Values
Tomo is innovative, health-focused, and intentional. The brand reflects a lifestyle built around natural eating, sustainability, and longevity. This should come through in tone and presentation — not as marketing claims, but as authentic character.

### The Story Behind Tomo
Founded in March 2025 by Luc and Tomek. The vision: food that makes sense — healthy, relevant across generations, aligned with how people want to live today. The website should include a subtle, well-crafted story section about the founders and the "why" behind Tomo.

### Grand Opening
Date: February 14, 2026 (Valentine's Day), 12:00. This should be clearly visible with a call-to-action.
